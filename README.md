# MLops Portfolio Project: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Engine

This repository contains a recommendation engine implemented using vanilla collaborative filtering. The project includes a Python implementation of the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm from scratch.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning solution with the following features:

- **ALS Collaborative Filtering**: A custom implementation of the ALS algorithm for user-item matrix factorization.
- **End-to-End MLOps Workflow**: Utilizes ZenML for creating and managing pipelines for model experimentation and training.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Employs Weights & Biases (wandb) for tracking and optimizing model performance and hyperparameters.
- **Flask Application**: A simple web application built with Flask that allows users to receive recommendations based on their ID.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the ALS algorithm and pipeline components.
- **ZenML**: Framework for managing machine learning pipelines.
- **Weights & Biases (wandb)**: Tool for experiment tracking and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Flask**: Framework for building the web application.

## Future Work

- **Cloud Deployment**: Plan to deploy the Flask application on cloud platforms.
- **Model Enhancement**: Explore advanced collaborative filtering techniques or hybrid models.
- **UI Improvement**: Enhance the user interface of the Flask application.
